# R.H Saunders Dam Station Project

## Installation
You will need to install the required library dependencies, it's recommended to create a virtual environment for this.

Install the dependencies from the `requirement.txt` file.

These scripts are in Jupyter Notebook, it is therefore useful to use VSCode to open them and run the scripts using the python virtual environment kernel.
